âœ… File Type

{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
"$schema": Informs tools (like VS Code) which JSON schema to use for validation and IntelliSense.

"https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json": A publicly hosted JSON Schema that defines what properties are allowed and their types for launchSettings.json.

âœ… profiles Section

  "profiles": {
"profiles": A section defining different launch configurations (environments) for your app.

Each profile describes:

How the app runs (command, ports, environment).

Whether the browser opens.

What environment variables are set.

ðŸ”¹ Profile: "http"

    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5200",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
Explanation
"http": The name of this launch profile. Used by tools like dotnet run --launch-profile http.

Inside "http":
Key	Meaning
"commandName": "Project"	Tells dotnet run to use the project file (e.g. .csproj) as the entry point.
"dotnetRunMessages": true	Enables helpful console messages during dotnet run (like which URL the server is listening on).
"launchBrowser": false	Prevents automatically launching a browser window when the app starts.
"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5200"	Specifies the URL the app listens on. Port 5200 in this case.
"environmentVariables"	Allows you to define environment variables at runtime.

"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
Sets the appâ€™s environment to "Development", which:

Enables Developer Exception Page.

Enables Swagger UI if coded that way.

Enables hot-reloading and more logging.

    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7082;http://localhost:5200",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
Explanation
"https": A second profile that enables both HTTPS and HTTP endpoints.

Inside "https":
"applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7082;http://localhost:5200":

Starts the server on two ports:

https://localhost:7082 (secure)

http://localhost:5200 (insecure fallback)

ASP.NET Core can listen on multiple endpoints simultaneously.

Other properties (commandName, dotnetRunMessages, launchBrowser, and ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT) are the same as in the "http" profile.
