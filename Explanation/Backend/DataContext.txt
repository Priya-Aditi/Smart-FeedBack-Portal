using SmartFeedbackAPI.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace SmartFeedbackAPI.Data;

public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DataContext(DbContextOptions<DataContext> options) : base(options)
    {

    }
    
     public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
}

1. using SmartFeedbackAPI.Models;
using: A directive that imports a namespace, so you can use its types without fully qualifying them.

SmartFeedbackAPI.Models: This is the namespace where your entity classes live, like User.

‚úÖ This allows you to use the User class directly in this file.

2. using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
Imports Entity Framework Core, Microsoft's object-relational mapper (ORM).

Required for using DbContext, DbSet<T>, and other EF Core features.

3. namespace SmartFeedbackAPI.Data;
Defines the namespace that this class belongs to.

This is a way to organize code into logical groups (like folders in a project).

Here, Data likely contains database-related classes like DataContext.

4. public class DataContext : DbContext
public: This class is accessible from other files/modules.

class: Declares a new class named DataContext.

DataContext: The name of this custom class. It's your app's database context.

:: Inheritance operator ‚Äî means this class inherits from another.

DbContext: Base class provided by EF Core to interact with the database.

üß† What is DbContext?

It represents a session with the database.

Lets you query and save data.

Maps your C# classes to database tables.

5. public DataContext(DbContextOptions<DataContext> options) : base(options)
This is the constructor of the DataContext class.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

public: Accessible outside this class.

DataContext(...): The constructor method for creating instances of DataContext.

DbContextOptions<DataContext> options:

A generic object holding settings like connection strings, DB provider (e.g., SQL Server), etc.

Provided by the dependency injection container in ASP.NET Core.

: base(options):

Passes options to the base class (DbContext) constructor.

This is how EF Core gets configured.

üß† This setup lets you configure your DB connection externally (e.g., in Startup.cs or Program.cs) and plug it in via DI.

6. public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
This line is extremely important ‚Äî it exposes a table in your database via a C# class.

Let‚Äôs break it down word-by-word:

public: Accessible from other parts of the application.

DbSet<User>:

A collection of User entities that EF Core tracks.

It represents a table in the database called Users (by default pluralized).

User is your model class, and its properties become the columns in that table.

Users:

The property name that your code will use to query/update this table.

Conventionally plural (e.g., Users, Products, etc.).

{ get; set; }:

Auto-implemented property.

EF Core needs both get and set to track this collection.

üß† EF will generate a Users table, and every row will be a User object.

üèÅ In Summary
Part	Purpose
DataContext	Main bridge between your C# code and the database
DbContext	EF Core base class that provides database functionality
DbSet<User>	Represents a table of User records
Constructor	Configures the context using dependency injection

üîß Real-world use:
You'd typically register this in your app like:

services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
Then, you can inject it into services or controllers:

public class AuthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly DataContext _context;
    public AuthController(DataContext context) => _context = context;
}
And use it like:

var users = await _context.Users.ToListAsync();
