namespace SmartFeedbackAPI.DTOs;

public class LoginDto
{
    public string Email { get; set; } = "";
    public string Password { get; set; } = "";
}

🔷 Line 1: namespace SmartFeedbackAPI.DTOs;
namespace:

This is how C# organizes code into logical containers.

A namespace acts like a folder or package.

You can reference types within this namespace in other files using using SmartFeedbackAPI.DTOs.

SmartFeedbackAPI.DTOs:

Custom namespace defined by the developer.

"DTOs" stands for Data Transfer Objects — lightweight classes used to carry data between client and server, or between layers in an app (e.g., controller → service).

This file’s class, LoginDto, is part of this namespace.

🔷 Line 3: public class LoginDto
public:

This class is accessible from anywhere in the project.

Without public, it would be internal by default (only accessible within the same assembly).

class:

A user-defined type that groups data and behavior (fields + methods).

Here it just holds data — no behavior.

LoginDto:

The name of the class.

By convention, Dto suffix = Data Transfer Object.

This particular DTO is used to accept or send login information (typically in a POST body).

🔷 Line 4: public string Email { get; set; } = "";
Let’s break it apart fully:

public:

This property (think: field with built-in getters and setters) is accessible outside this class.

string:

The data type — holds a text value.

This will store the email address of the user trying to log in.

Email:

The name of the property.

C# naming convention is PascalCase for public members.

{ get; set; }:

This is an auto-implemented property.

get retrieves the value; set assigns a new value.

No need to manually write backing fields.

= "":

Initializes the Email property to an empty string.

This avoids null values unless explicitly set to null.

🔷 Line 5: public string Password { get; set; } = "";
Same structure as Email.

Holds the plaintext password entered by the user in a login form.

🛡️ Note: It’s common (and recommended) not to expose passwords in DTOs when responding to the client — this DTO is only used for receiving login requests.

🔐 Summary: What does this class do?
It's a simple container for login request data: email and password.

The client (frontend app) sends this data in a POST request body, and the server binds it to this DTO object.

👇 Example usage:
When a client sends a request like:

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "mySecret123"
}
ASP.NET Core will automatically bind that request body to a LoginDto object like:

[HttpPost("login")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginDto dto)
{
    // dto.Email => "user@example.com"
    // dto.Password => "mySecret123"
}
🧠 Key Concepts Introduced
Concept	Explanation
namespace	Organizes code logically.
DTO	Simplified class to transfer data across system boundaries.
public class	Class that can be used anywhere.
Auto-properties	Short-hand for properties with get/set.
Initialization (= "")	Avoids null reference exceptions.
